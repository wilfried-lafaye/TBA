The actions module contains the functions that are called when a command is executed in the game.

Each function in the Actions class takes 3 parameters:
- game: the game object
- list_of_words: the list of words in the command
- number_of_parameters: the number of parameters expected by the command

The functions return True if the command was executed successfully, False otherwise.
The functions print an error message if the number of parameters is incorrect.
